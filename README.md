# nutrimoist

A landing page made for the landing page project in FreeCodeCamp. 

This is a 4-rows landing page consists of:
1. Call-to-Action section
2. Reason section
3. How it works section
4. Contact Us section

It uses CSS Grid and Flexbox. 
Until July 29th, the mobile-view landing page is still under development. 

Thanks
